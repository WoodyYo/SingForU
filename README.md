# Cluster
Go to __ML/cluster__ and run __$python genDistMat.py__ to generate __distmtx.mat__ and __urls.mat__.

Than run complete cluster to generate a list of labels. The number of clusters is parametrized by the variable __threshold__.

If u like to analyze the clusters in direct way, you may go to __ML__ and run __$python move_stuffs__
